# convert uppercase without upper()
# this program converts all characters of the string into upper case without upper() function.

# ask the user for a string
# initialize an empty string to store the result
# iterate through each character in the string
# if the character is lowercase, convert it to uppercase by subtracting 32 from its ASCII value
# append the converted character to the result string(or if it is already uppercase, append it as it is))
# print the result string
